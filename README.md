# Deep-Learning-Fitness-Estimation-ECG
This project applies deep learning to estimate VO2max and other CRF metrics using resting ECG data from ~8,700 UK Biobank participants. By utilizing pre-trained PCLR embeddings and transfer learning, the model eliminates the need for costly and risky maximal exercise testing.
